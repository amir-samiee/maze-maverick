# Maze Maverick Game

Maze Maverick is an interactive C++ console-based game that involves creating, solving, and playing mazes. The program also features a history log of games played and a leaderboard showcasing top players. The game utilizes a two-dimensional array to represent mazes, where non-zero values indicate the passable files, and zeros represent blocked files.

## Features

1. **Create a New Map:**
   - Generate a new maze with varying difficulty levels (easy or hard).
   
2. **Playground:**
   - Interactively navigate through existing mazes or import custom ones.
   
3. **Solve a Maze:**
   - Utilize maze-solving algorithms to find a path from the starting point to the end point.
   
4. **History:**
   - Display a log of previously played games.
   
5. **Users:**
   - View user information and statistics.

   - Clear user and game history data while preserving maps.
   
8. **Clear Maps:**
   - Remove all existing maps.

## Game Mechanics

- The mazes are represented by numerical values in a two-dimensional array.
- The goal is to navigate from the top left corner to the bottom right corner while arranging the sum of values along the path to be equal to the value of the end point.
- The program employs maze-solving algorithms to find a valid path through the maze.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
